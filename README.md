# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Analyzing Shoe Reviews on Amazon.com

- Big Data - PySpark, Google Colab, SQL & AWS

## Overview of the analysis: 
Analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine Program. I used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and loaded the transformed data into pgAdmin. Lastly I used SQL to determine if there was any bias toward favorable reviews for Vine members in my dataset.
